            <p class="lead"><b>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised
                code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization.The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including
                writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected
                to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</b></p><br />
            <p class="lead"><b>Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. The most common languages used for Web programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript,
                Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just programming, which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server scripting, and database technology.</b></p>
